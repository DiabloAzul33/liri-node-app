# liri-node-app / LIRI bot
*LIRI bot hw*

In this app we are trying to take different commands and pull the specific information from a few diferent APIs. There are four different commands used through node to retrieve the data from Bands In Town, OMDB and Spotify. This could be a song giving the details on the artist and album as well as a preview of the song. The concert tour of a band or a cursory overview of a movie including the plot and actors involved.

To run this app simply open up the folder containing the liri.js file in terminal/bash and install the axios, fs, dotenv, and node-spotify-api packages. Then you will be able to run within the folder "node liri.js" + any one of four commands: "spotify-this-song", "do-what-it-says", "movie-this", and "concert-this". The "do-what-it-says" command allows the user to read what is written in the random.txt file and perform that command within terminal/bash. Additionally it will log the command used into log.txt.
